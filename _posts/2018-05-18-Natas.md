## Level 0
Opening http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org and entering the username and password "natas0" we are presented with this page:

![natas0](/img/natas/natas0.png)

We're told the password is on the page, but nothing we can see is obviously password looking... let's check out the page's source (ctrl + u in chrome or firefox):

```html
<html>
<head>
<!-- This stuff in the header has nothing to do with the level -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/level.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/jquery-ui.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/wechall.css" />
<script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>
<script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/jquery-ui.js"></script>
<script src=http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/wechall-data.js></script><script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/wechall.js"></script>
<script>var wechallinfo = { "level": "natas0", "pass": "natas0" };</script>
</head>
<body>
<h1>natas0</h1>
<div id="content">
You can find the password for the next level on this page.
<!--The password for natas1 is gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto -->
</div>
</body>
</html>
```
<br>

Looking at the source the first thing we come across is some code wrapped in a <head> tag. We use the header element in HTML as a container for metadata about the page, so it's often a good place to look for clues. In this case the first line is a comment explicitly telling us the header has nothing to do with this level. While it's good policy not to believe everything we read, let's skip to the body and see if there's anything juicy there. The fourth line in the body is a comment giving us the password! It doesn't get much more juicy than that!

Level 0 was a nice easy one to get us started, let's crack on to level 1.

<hr>
<br>
## Level 1
This one looks a bit like the previous, except that right clicking has been disabled.

![natas1](/img/natas/natas1.png)

It's a good idea to check that security policies are actually doing what they say on the tin. We confirm that right clicking is genuinely disabled by right clicking and getting this pop up, yep, looks like we can't right click. This sort of functionality is the domain of javascript.

A few possibilities to get around this jump to mind, we could:
* Use a plug-in like noscript to disable JS running on this site.
* Capture the raw request with Burp or another proxy (we'll start doing this later, that's when the fun stuff begins).
* Use our keyboard shortcut to view the source (using ctrl + u in chrome) like last time.

Let's go with option three:

```html
<html>
<head>
<!-- This stuff in the header has nothing to do with the level -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/level.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/jquery-ui.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/wechall.css" />
<script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>
<script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/jquery-ui.js"></script>
<script src=http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/wechall-data.js></script><script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/wechall.js"></script>
<script>var wechallinfo = { "level": "natas1", "pass": "gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto" };</script></head>
<body oncontextmenu="javascript:alert('right clicking has been blocked!');return false;">
<h1>natas1</h1>
<div id="content">
You can find the password for the
next level on this page, but rightclicking has been blocked!
<!--The password for natas2 is ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi -->
</div>
</body>
</html>
```
<br>
Once again the password for the next level is explicitly given in an html comment. Onto the next one!

<hr>
<br>
## Level 2
![natas2](/img/natas/natas2.png)
The third level and the third time we're presented with a page that looks much the same. This time it's telling us that there's nothing on this page, let's check the source to make sure.
```html
<html>
<head>
<!-- This stuff in the header has nothing to do with the level -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/level.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/jquery-ui.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/wechall.css" />
<script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>
<script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/jquery-ui.js"></script>
<script src=http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/wechall-data.js></script><script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/wechall.js"></script>
<script>var wechallinfo = { "level": "natas2", "pass": "ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi" };</script></head>
<body>
<h1>natas2</h1>
<div id="content">
There is nothing on this page
<img src="files/pixel.png">
</div>
</body></html>
```
<br>
Looks like the maker wasn't lying to us.

A good first step when we come across an unfamiliar website is to enumerate the contents we have access to on the server. We can manually try URIs like natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt or /admin, directories or files we'll commonly be interested in. On our current server all we're getting back are 404s.  

If we didn't have any hints now would be a good time to fire up a file and directory bruteforcer, but maybe there's a better way here.
We notice in the source there's an image pixel.png being served, ```<img src="files/pixel.png">```. Let's see if we can access the /files directory that contains the image.


![natas2-2](/img/natas/natas2-2.png)

Bingo. We have access to the /files directory, and what's more we're presented with a directory listing. That users.txt file looks interesting:

```
# username:password
alice:BYNdCesZqW
bob:jw2ueICLvT
charlie:G5vCxkVV3m
natas3:sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14
eve:zo4mJWyNj2
mallory:9urtcpzBmH
```

<br>
And there's the password! Time for level 3!
<hr>
<br>

## Level 3
As in the previous levels there's nothing obvious on the landing page, but there seems to be a clue in an html comment:

```<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->```

That's interesting. Generally search engines index sites using web crawlers. If we don't want crawlers or other bots looking at certain areas of our sites we can let them know by using a [robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard) file. Let's see if this level has a robots.txt file. By navigating to to natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt we see:

```txt
>User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/
```
So the maker of the site is requesting bots to not visit the /s3cr3t/ directory, that's definitely something we'll want to have a look at:
<br>

![natas3-2](/img/natas/natas3-2.png)

Once again we see the directory contains a user.txt file and inside we have the password for the next level:

>natas4:Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ

Robots.txt files have their place, but it's important to know their limitations. Entries are just requests to avoid assets, malicious bots can simply choose to ignore our requests. What's more if we include assets that we want to remain hidden in a robots.txt file we're almost *ensuring* they'll be looked at by a manual adversary.

<hr>
<br>


## Level 4
Opening level 4 we see a message that authorised users should come from "natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org".

![natas4-1](/img/natas/natas4-1.png)

The idea with this level is to work out how the web server is identifying where we are coming from, and to spoof that identification so it appears we're coming from Natas5. It's a good bet that the server is using the [HTTP referer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) field to identify where we're coming from, so let's aim to intercept and modify the request we send. This is a job for Burp*. Setting up burp is outside of the scope of this writeup but there are lots of [good guides](https://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_gettingstarted) online.

Once we have identified the request we want to modify from the "Site Map" screen we right click on the request and send it to repeater.

![natas4-3](/img/natas/natas4-4.png)

Repeater is split into two windows. The left window is our request which we can edit, and then resend with the "Go" button. The right window displays the response from the server:

![natas4-4](/img/natas/natas4-3.png)

We want to add a referer header, so we go to the "headers" tab on the left window and hit "add". We can then add our referer header, note that we intentionally mispell "Referrer" as "Referer", a hangover from a typo on an old RFC. Hitting go and examining the response window we see that we have been successful:

![natas4-5](/img/natas/natas4-5.png)

*Or Zap, Fiddler, or any number of other web proxies.

<hr>
<br>

That's the first five levels of Natas done! We've gone from having the password handed to us in the page source, to some basic enumeration, to using a proxy to modify requests. In the next few levels we'll keep up the burp work, and start to add some cookie editing, and source code auditing.
